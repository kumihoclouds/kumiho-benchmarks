Remember how you adjusted your exercise routine due to chronic knee pain from a marathon, switching to gentle yoga for a more suitable, low-impact exercise? This change was supported by Jolene, who suggested low-impact exercises considering your condition. You might find it helpful to apply a similar approach to your hiking preparation. Consider incorporating low-impact activities like water aerobics, which you opted for as a gentler alternative, to build endurance without straining your knees. Additionally, your experience with yoga, particularly beach yoga, has been a calming and strengthening practice for you. Integrating yoga into your routine could help improve your flexibility and strength, making the hike more manageable. Remember, it's about finding a pace that works for you and enjoying the journey, much like how you found peace and enjoyment in yoga and nature during your travels to Bali.",

Just as you are meticulous about maintaining client trust, perhaps it's worth reflecting on how you can apply that same care to your own boundaries. Balancing this could be as important as your disciplined study routine or your dedication to your fitness goals.",
